      <h2>PollLeague.com Rules and Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to PollLeague.com! Please read these rules carefully to
        understand how to play and what you can expect from this unique,
        fantasy-style experience for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. By
        participating in PollLeague, you agree to follow these rules.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Game Rules</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Predictions:</strong> Toggle the states between Red (Trump),
        Blue (Harris), and Gray (Other) to make your selections. Players can
        only have one prediction map, but may join multiple leagues. Don’t
        forget to hit Save before the countdown ends to lock in your selections.
        Your predictions are private until the countdown ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Leagues:</strong> Players can create private leagues with
        friends or join existing leagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Buy-In:</strong> Each league has a set buy-in amount that you
        agree to by joining the league. Make sure to confirm the buy-in amount
        with your friends before joining. This buy-in should not be considered
        to be real money, rather to fictionally up the stakes among friends!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Lock-In Time and Date:</strong> Predictions must be saved by 6
        PM EST on Election Day, November 5, 2024. No changes can be made to
        predictions after this time.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Scoring and Results</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scoring:</strong> There are a maximum of 538 points available,
        representing the total number of electoral college votes. Players are
        awarded points based on the number of electoral votes in states they
        predict correctly. If you correctly predict a candidate’s victory in a
        state, you receive that state's full electoral points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Electoral College Points:</strong> Points are awarded based on
        correctly predicted states. For example, if you predict the winning
        candidate in a state with 10 electoral votes, you earn 10 points. For
        Maine and Nebraska, you can win points for correctly guessing each of
        the statewide and district level votes. The goal is to accumulate as
        many of the 538 total points as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tie-Breaker:</strong> In case of a tie, tied players will split
        the pot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Final Standings:</strong> After official election results, each
        league’s standings and collective map are updated, and players can see
        their ranks among their friends.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Payouts</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Fictional Payouts:</strong> The top player(s) in each league
        will be awarded fictional payouts based on the league’s fictional pot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-Transferable:</strong> These payouts hold no real monetary
        value and cannot be exchanged, transferred, or redeemed.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Conduct and Fair Play</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Cheating:</strong> Any attempt to manipulate or tamper with
        predictions, scores, or standings will result in immediate
        disqualification from the site.
      </p>
